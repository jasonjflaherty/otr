In many cases, Indian tribes continue their traditional uses of the nation’s forests and grasslands to sustain their cultural identity and continuity, and for economic development. The Government’s trust responsibilities and treaty obligations make it essential that the Forest Service engages with Indian tribes in timely and meaningful consultation on policies that may affect Indian tribes. In addition to consultation, coordination and collaboration lead to information exchange, mutual understanding, informed decision-making, and mutual benefit. The value of collaboration is fully recognized within the Forest Service for all of its constituents, including Indian tribes as a support process for government-to-government consultation. \n Forest Service and USDA Authorities and Rules",

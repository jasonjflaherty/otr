In many cases, Indian tribes continue their traditional uses of the nation's forests and grasslands to sustain their cultural identity and continuity, and for economic development. The Government's trust responsibilities and treaty obligations make it essential that the Forest Service engages with Indian tribes in timely and meaningful consultation on policies that may affect Indian tribes. In addition to consultation, coordination and collaboration lead to information exchange, mutual understanding, informed decision-making, and mutual benefit. The value of collaboration is fully recognized within the Forest Service for all of its constituents, including Indian tribes as a support process for government-to-government consultation.</p><h2>Forest Service and USDA Authorities and Rules</h2><p><strong>Forest Service Tribal Relations Directives (FSH 1509.13 and FSM 1500).</strong> The Forest Service Manual and Handbook for tribal relations were published on March 9, 2016. These directives institutionalize and tailor the agency-wide practices of tribal consultation and engagement.  Perhaps the most significant aspect of the new directives is the clear emphasis that every part of the Forest Service involves Tribal relations, and working with Tribes is part of every employee's job. <a href=\"https://www.fs.fed.us/spf/tribalrelations/authorities.shtml\">https://www.fs.fed.us/spf/tribalrelations/authorities.shtml</a></p><p><strong>Title 36, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 219 (Planning Rule).</strong> The Forest Service's 2012 Planning Rule provides direction for National Forest System NFS land management planning.

In many cases, Indian tribes continue their traditional uses of the nation's forests and grasslands to sustain their cultural identity and continuity, and for economic development. The Government's trust responsibilities and treaty obligations make it essential that the Forest Service engages with Indian tribes in timely and meaningful consultation on policies that may affect Indian tribes. In addition to consultation, coordination and collaboration lead to information exchange, mutual understanding, informed decision-making, and mutual benefit. The value of collaboration is fully recognized within the Forest Service for all of its constituents, including Indian tribes as a support process for government-to-government consultation.</p>",

McIntosh (1823) The US Supreme Court decided that although Indians were the rightful occupants of the land, tribes had no power to sell lands to anyone without the approval of the federal government, as clearly stated in the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act. The ruling claimed that because the federal government held title to all Indian lands which Europeans had &ldquo;discovered,&rdquo; the right of Indians to complete sovereignty over their land was limited.</p><p>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) The US Supreme Court decided that Indians were neither citizens of the United States, nor foreign nations; instead, they were &ldquo;domestic dependent nations&rdquo; whose relationship to the US &ldquo;resembles that of a ward to his guardian.&rdquo; This ruling set a legal precedent for the trust relationship in which the US has a duty to provide certain benefits and services for the Indian tribes and people.</p><p>Worcester v. Georgia (1832) The US Supreme Court decided that the state had no authority over persons and actions within the boundaries of the Cherokee Nation, and that state laws did not extend to Indian Country.
